Project 5 of the Web Developer path is a back-end server built with the Express.js framework.
The app provides a secure API for a client ecommerce site. 

### Server Installation ###
From the root folder of the project, run `npm install` to add the required dependencies.
You can then run the server with `npm run start` or `npm run devel`.
The server should listen on default port `3000` at the address `localhost`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.


### Availability of front-end server ###
Open Classrooms maintains a repository of the [front-end code](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/Web-Developer-P6) for the project.
